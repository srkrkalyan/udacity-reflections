When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
to share with other developers/programmers

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
i need to have control on pull,so i can work on some new features/bug fixes on older commits

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork - its like clone, but on github, this gets a clone of the repository into our github account
clones - it gets a github repository into local, infact clones any remote repository to local
branch - a branch can be created on any old commit from local repository
