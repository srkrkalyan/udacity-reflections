How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helps me to identify accidentally keyed in values.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    If i need prior version of the code, i need not to delete content from new file, instead i can pick up old file

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: programmer has control and proper track of his changes for future reference cons: I dont see any

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    git is specifically designed for version controlling of code. Application code always spawn across multiple files. G docs designed not for code and hence version contolling on only 1 file at a time

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log gives complete history of the repository and git diff helps to compare adds/diffs b/w different commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    very confident bcoz anytime i can go back and get my previous working code

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    i want to start using it for Blog web site creation
